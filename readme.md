**The Preparation: How To Become Competent, Confident, and Dangerous**

4.7 out of 5 stars, 39 ratings

**Skip the debt. Build the man.**

What if you could trade four stagnant years in lecture halls for four years of adventure — emerging as a debt‑free
EMT, pilot, welder, web/app builder, rancher, and entrepreneur all in one?

**The Preparation** is the field manual for young men (and the parents who love them)
who know the old college formula is broken and want a roadmap
that actually forges competence, confidence, and real‑world value.

Written by three generations — legendary investor and bestselling author Doug Casey,
entrepreneur Matt Smith, and twenty‑year‑old “beta tester” Maxim Smith —
this book distills their hard‑won wisdom into a four‑year, 16‑cycle program you can start tomorrow.

- **16 themed cycles** — Medic, Cowboy, Pilot, Fighter, Hacker, Maker, and more —
  each built around a hands‑on “Anchor Course” that forces you to learn by doing, not by cramming.
- **Earn‑while‑you‑learn design** shows you exactly how to pay your way through each cycle and graduate debt‑free.
- **Cost: roughly one year of tuition** – yet delivers four years of marketable skills,
  global travel, and a network of do‑ers, not talkers.
- **Foundational philosophy** rooted in Stoicism and Renaissance thinking so you don’t just master tasks — you master yourself.
- **Bullet‑proof curriculum** : step‑by‑step schedules, book lists, online courses,
  and locations for every skill so you’re never guessing what to do next.
- **Battle‑tested results** — Maxim used the program to rack up EMT shifts on Oregon wildfires,
  fly solo over the Rockies, ranch in Uruguay, and sail the Strait of Magellan before he turned twenty.

**The Problem:**
College now averages $140,000+
and often delivers little more than ideology, debt, and obsolete credentials.

**The Preparation:**
compresses that money and time into a crucible
that turns raw potential into a modern‑day Renaissance Man —
one who can protect, build, heal, sell, and lead
in a world being up‑ended by AI and economic turmoil.

If you — or a young man you care about —
refuse to become road‑kill on the conventional path,
open this book and start Cycle One today.

The world won’t wait, and neither should you.
